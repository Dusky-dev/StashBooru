# StashBooru implementation progress

Updated: 2026-10-01

Current baseline: `develop` at `3ce826575874c9eb7550cb7c43cf832e45a0cc32`
(merged PR #117). Active follow-up: `fix/p06-association-consistency-20261001`.

| Package | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P01 — backup compatibility warning | Complete | Covered by merged PR #91; further backend backup-contract work intentionally skipped per project-owner direction. |
| P02 — image similarity modes | Complete | Merged PR #92 adds explicit pHash and EVA02 modes for image Find similar. |
| P03 — visual comparison / difference highlighting | Complete | Merged PR #93. Scope remains the bounded still-image comparison described below; automatic alignment and video frame selection are not implemented. |
| P04 — copyright sorting / taxonomy | Complete | PRs #94 and #95 are merged. PR #94 added the hierarchy/backend foundation; PR #95 corrected hierarchy UX and media presentation without changing the P04 database schema. |
| P05 — Character variants / disambiguation links | Complete | Merged PR #104 adds native Character variants and typed Copyright/Artist disambiguation links; merged PR #114 refines Character/Copyright editing. |
| P06 — ancestor/profile auto-association | Complete; search consistency follow-up awaiting remote checks | PRs #115, #116 and #117 are merged. The follow-up makes hierarchical Image/Video Tag searches and Tag detail media counts include live profile-derived memberships. Direct legacy relationships remain explicit; no migration is introduced. |

## P04 completed behavior

Backend and data-model work from merged PR #94 is preserved:

- Native Copyright IDs and parent/child relations remain the hierarchy source of truth.
- Multi-parent Copyrights are supported; hierarchy writes reject self-links, missing targets and cycles.
- Copyright directory sorting supports name/sort name, timestamps, direct media counts, descendant-inclusive counts and stable ID tie-breaking.
- Descendant-aware media filtering/counting counts distinct media across converging hierarchy paths.
- Breadcrumbs and per-parent manual sibling ordering remain available.
- Existing deletion behavior keeps media and child records rather than cascading media deletion.

Corrective UX in merged PR #95 (`fix/p04-main-sub-branch-grouping`, based on `develop` at `ae28561d057ff0e2d75136b9fc6da67c941608fd`):

- Removed the separate Flat/Tree Copyright-directory mode. The directory uses the normal Stash Grid/List display controls only.
- Copyright detail pages expose hierarchy navigation through native Bootstrap/Stash-style **Main** and **Sub** tabs. Main shows parent/main Copyright relationships; Sub shows child/sub-Copyright relationships and manual child ordering. Breadcrumb navigation remains available.
- Removed the visible free-form Structural Role controls from Copyright and Tag details. The merged schema field is retained for compatibility but is not part of the corrected P04 UX because it currently has no functional behavior.
- Removed the Image/Video global Primary Copyright selector. The merged schema/API field is retained for compatibility, but the corrected presentation no longer relies on one globally preferred Copyright merely to put it first.
- Image and Video Copyright presentation now fetches hierarchy breadcrumbs and groups attached Copyrights by independent hierarchy root/branch. When several attached Copyrights share a branch and diverge below it, the group heading uses their common hierarchy prefix. This allows unrelated branches such as Pokémon and Super Mario to remain separate on the same media item.
- New hierarchy UI reuses React-Bootstrap/native Stash controls and existing card/theme classes rather than adding raw always-visible inputs.

### P04 migration / compatibility impact

- PR #95 adds no migration and does not alter the merged P04 hierarchy tables or validation logic.
- `structural_role`, `primary_copyright` and related merged API/storage remain readable for compatibility. Their mistaken/decorative UI is removed rather than destructively migrating existing databases.
- A future compatibility-cleanup package may deprecate those dormant fields if desired; that is not required for the corrected Main/Sub hierarchy behavior.

### P04 verification

Code head `67f72916f09dddb72edb0be439a099bc52725edc` passed the repository GitHub Actions gates before this ledger update:

- backend generation and `golangci-lint` — passed;
- UI generation — passed;
- UI test suite — 17 tests passed;
- JavaScript/CSS lint — passed;
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` — passed;
- Biome formatting — passed;
- UI production build — passed;
- backend test job — passed;
- cross-platform build matrix — passed, including Linux, Linux ARM variants, Windows, FreeBSD and macOS.

The first corrective CI attempts exposed formatting-only Biome failures. Those were fixed; no test, lint or TypeScript failure remained on the validated code head above.

## P05 Character variants and disambiguation links

- Characters remain native Performer records with their own IDs, aliases, images, tags and metadata. Each Character can optionally point to one base Character; validation rejects missing parents, self-links and cycles.
- Character details show a “Variant of” link and a Variants tab with a card grid. The edit form selects child variants from the parent Character.
- A Character disambiguation selector chooses Copyright, Artist, or Custom. Copyright and Artist choices link the target name; Custom is a plain label. Disambiguation context does not create a media association.
- Migration 95 adds the parent and context foreign keys with `ON DELETE SET NULL`, a check against self-parenting and indexes for lookups.

### P05 verification

- Backend gqlgen and dataloader generation passed.
- UI GraphQL generation, TypeScript check, Biome lint and formatting passed.
- `go test ./pkg/performer ./internal/api` passed with the repository SQLite include flags.
- The focused SQLite integration test `Test_PerformerVariantAndDisambiguationContext` passed, covering persistence, variant lookup, context switching, and cleanup after deleting linked records.

P05 is complete and merged in PRs #104 and #114.

## P04/P05 hierarchy and disambiguation UX follow-up — merged PR #114

- Copyright pages use Copyright/Main/Sub terminology; the editor can select both Main and Sub-Copyrights, empty hierarchy tabs are hidden, and related Copyrights display as cards. Image/Video detail sidebars render Main/Sub hierarchy paths as cards too.
- The optional alphabetical sort name now has an example explaining how it affects ordering.
- Character Copyright associations display as cards before the other detail fields, with singular/plural labeling. Character variants are edited as child selections and displayed as cards.
- Character disambiguation uses one Copyright/Artist/Custom selector with Stash-native styling. The New Sub-Copyright action was removed.
- PR #114 changes only the UI and progress ledger; it adds no schema, migration, or backend changes.

## P06 ancestor/profile auto-association — PRs #115, #116 and #117

- Merged PR #115 supplies Image/Scene effective associations, descendant-aware searches/counts and four independent ancestor defaults. Merged PR #116 adds per-membership provenance and the linked association-source presentation.
- PR #117 shares native direct-association loaders between Image/Video detail reads and the existing-library review, de-duplicates legacy primary Artists and multi-Artist links, and fixes inherited Tagging preview reads to own a SQLite read transaction.
- Native direct relationships remain the editable selections. Ancestors and profile Tags are live projections; shared sources, explicit parents and legacy assignments remain distinguishable. Reparenting changes the next read without rewriting media.
- Settings → Tasks now offers a Review library inheritance preview/apply task through the native Jobs queue. It reviews every existing Image/Video with paginated reads, reports inherited totals and membership deltas, and shows bounded before/after samples with provenance links. Cancellation and per-item errors are visible.
- Apply fingerprints every media item's complete provenance and rechecks the library under a native write transaction before atomically saving the reviewed defaults. Changed associations, profiles, hierarchy or defaults require a new preview. No inherited IDs are copied into direct native tables.
- The reviewed backfill activates the existing library's live projection. System and Tagging share all four enabled-by-default switches, with links from System to the task and Tagging to System.
- Fresh SQLite integration fixtures exercise actual single and bulk GraphQL mutations, reviewed Image/Video Tagging, bulk Video filename review/apply, native Auto Tag, import/repeated import and scan/rescan. They verify direct-only selections, derived membership/provenance, Copyright/Tag diamonds, shared-source detach, explicit-parent retention and native reparenting. Task tests cover pagination, stale previews, invalid-write rollback, errors and cancellation.
- Review state is transient: terminal reports expire after 30 minutes, at most eight reviews are retained, and restarting the server requires another preview. Scan tests stub only thumbnail/cover generation. External model/booru availability and manual browser interaction are outside this follow-up's verification.

The behavior and workflow matrix are documented in [P06 effective associations](p06-effective-associations.md).

### P06 Tag search consistency follow-up — 2026-10-01

- Reproduced a missing acceptance case on merged `develop`: the Image/Video
  detail projection included Artist profile Tags, but the native Tag filter
  returned no media for the same Tag.
- Image/Video Tag `INCLUDES`, `INCLUDES_ALL` and `EXCLUDES` now resolve effective
  memberships through native links, selected profiles, enabled ancestor profiles
  and enabled Tag ancestors. Tag detail media counts use the same native query.
- Searches expand only the requested Tag and supplying profile metadata, then
  join indexed native media relationships. They do not load every media item,
  materialize inherited links, or change IDs, fingerprints or provenance.
- Independent source paths and Copyright/Tag diamonds count each media once.
  The existing server-side sort/pagination and explicit descendant-depth control
  remain available. Exact-set/null criteria, Tag-count maintenance criteria and
  nested `tags_filter` retain their native direct-link semantics.
- New `internal/api/p06_tag_search_integration_test.go` checks the native SQL
  results against the independent Go effective-association projection for both
  media types and all 16 defaults. It also checks Tag detail counts, shared
  sources, exclusions, pagination, profile edits, reparenting, explicit-link
  retention after detach and termination on a malformed legacy Tag cycle.
- Local verification passed: focused native search regressions;
  `make generate-backend`; the full `make it` integration suite;
  `make lint` (zero issues); and `git diff --check`.
  Validated code commit: `c8e7f9c636bd0a1d7ef73103e1a525e89cf565e0`.
- Remote review uses `fix/p06-association-consistency-20261001` against
  `develop`. Local verification is complete; remote platform-build/CI gates
  still need to pass before merge. Do not merge without instruction.
- No database, GraphQL, UI or writer changes. P07 remains the next roadmap
  package; this branch is limited to the P06 Tag search correction.

### P06 verification

Code head `dfdd33bccae9971af298c666a1d4acbfa535226c` passed the [Build workflow](https://github.com/Dusky-dev/StashBooru/actions/runs/36761342091) and [Go lint workflow](https://github.com/Dusky-dev/StashBooru/actions/runs/36761342087) on 2026-09-30:

- Backend generation and `golangci-lint` passed.
- `make it` (`go test -tags integration ./...`) passed, including the real SQLite API/configuration tests and the new native workflow matrix.
- All seven platform builds passed: Linux, Linux ARM64/ARMv7/ARMv6, Windows, FreeBSD and macOS.
- The unchanged UI passed all 20 tests, JavaScript/CSS lint, TypeScript, Biome formatting and the production build at code head `2a4c1b6d6bbc32ce2b1409c457fcbad9d0b8bd32` in the [UI/build workflow](https://github.com/Dusky-dev/StashBooru/actions/runs/36758817817). Later code commits change only backend integration tests; CI reuses that validated UI build.

No browser interaction or external inference/booru service test is claimed.

## P03 validation scope

- Reuses the existing `ReferenceComparison` Lightbox path rather than introducing a second comparison UI.
- Keeps existing side-by-side, wipe, and synchronized pan/zoom behavior.
- Difference mode is deliberately limited to still images. Animated/video media reports that an explicit frame or timestamp is required instead of comparing arbitrary frames.
- Pixel work is bounded to a centered-fit canvas of at most 2048 pixels per dimension and about 1.5 million pixels.
- Different aspect ratios are not stretched; unmatched borders remain visible difference evidence.
- Difference boxes are connected pixel-difference regions after threshold/noise filtering, not object detection.
- Browser decoding supplies orientation/color handling for this first pass; automatic crop/rotation registration is not implemented.
- No database or GraphQL schema changes.
